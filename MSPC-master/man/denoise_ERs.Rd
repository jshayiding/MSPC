\usage{
denoise_ERs(peakGRs, tau.w = 1e-04, nmtab = "noise", dest.dir = tempdir(),
  overwrite = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{peakGRs}{Chip-seq replicate imported and
all enriched regions stored in \code{GRanges} objects}

\item{tau.w}{permissive p-value threshold for weakly
enriched peak, all enrichred regions' pvalue above
this thrshold, are considered background noise}

\item{nmtab}{Character string that assigned as name to the noise}

\item{dest.dir}{dirctory that exported files can be placed.
only noise can be exported as standard BED file;}

\item{overwrite}{default FALSE indicating whether
existing files with identical name should be over-written.}
}
\value{
Peaks without background noise is
stoted in \link[GenomicRanges]{GRangesList}
}
\description{
Given the output of \link{readPeakFiles}, We set up
permissive p-value threshold \code{tau.w} for weakly
enriched regions associated with score and p-value.
We are interested in moderately enriched regions ,
but extremely weakly enriched regions
must be removed from all candidate sample because it
will not give any biological insight. Note that p-value
threshold can be tuned by users, so using different
threshold value will result in different filtering results.
Background signal (A.K.A, noise) also exported as standard
BED file by using \link[rtracklayer]{export.bed} for the sake of
evaluate each ChIP-Seq replicate that bearing different
output set with clear biological evidence.

## read peak file as GRanges object

grs <- readPeakFiles(files, pvalueBase=1L)

## Exclude background noise
