Description: This packages implements set of functions to retrieve overlapped
    enriched regions across multiple replicates in parallel (a.k.a, pair-wise),
    statistical method for overlapped regions. simultaneous presence of an
    enriched regions in replicates experiment would justify a local decrease of
    the stringency criterion, leveraging on the principal that repeated evidence
    is compensating for weak evidence. This packages jointly analyzes the enriched
    regions of multiple replicates, distinguishing between biological and technical
    replicates, and accepting user defined parameters.
